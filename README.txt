My web page contains four diferent html pages I named them “Nutrition” “Maca” “Mushrooms”  and “Vitamins” then by using a href command I create hyperlink which is taking you to wiki page I named it “Supplement” You can see it on the left top corner. 
Then by using command -ul- snd -ol- I was able to create Un order and order lists. You may find this information in section “Nutrition”  
On order list have information such as: Maca, Reishi, Astragalus, Turmeric cur cumin, Chaga. Order list: Ginger, Fish oil, Garlic, Beets… 
You will be able to see that I used 5 different CSS properties and 5 CSS selectors by changing colors and type of my texts, tables. 
By Using #id selector I was able to create information such as “Vegetables” “Fruits” “Mushrooms” “Roots” Also by using CSS I was able to change the colors. You can find this information in my page “Nutrition” almost at the very end.
 When you look below You will be able to see .class selector I had to use CSS to change the colors and set the parameters you can see I put information about vitamins “A, B, D….”
 Also if you will try to shrink my page you will see it will turn white @Media.
